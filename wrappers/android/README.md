# 			Intel RealSense ID Android wrapper

For your convinience, we offer a Java API to be used for Android application development. If, for any reason, you prefer not to use it, you can take the regular C or C++ API and wrap it with your own JNI code and Java/Kotlin classes.

RealSense ID Android wrapper is making use of [SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIG) to wrap the C++ API and offer an easy to use, simple to extend Java API for developing an appication that interacts with the F45# camera module. This way, not only the C++ API is translated to Java, but also the Doxygen Documenation that goes with it is transfered.

The code generation is automatically triggered prior to compilation, by [src/main/CMakeLists.txt](src/main/CMakeLists.txt).
JNI code will be generated to src/main/cpp_gen and Java code will be in src/main/java/com/intel/realsenseid/api.
In src/main/java/com/intel/realsenseid/impl we manually define helper classes that are unique for Android and are not simply a translation of the API between the programing languages.

The instructions for SWIG about which API to wrap and how to do it is found in [swig.i.in](src/main/swig.i.in).
In order to avoid rewriting of the complicated implementation of signature handling found in the c signature example, a separete interface file named [signature_example_wrapper.i.in](src/main/signature_example_wrapper.i.in) was created to wrap that code as well.

```NOTE: signature_example_wrapper.i.in SHOULD NOT be used in production for security reasons, since signature example C code was not meant to be used in production.```
